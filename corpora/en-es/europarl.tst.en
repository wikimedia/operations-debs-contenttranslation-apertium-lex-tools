B5-0152/2003, by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD group, on the situation in Kazakhstan.

We tell the Iraqi Kurds that this will be fantastic, that we are going to liberate them using the Turkish army.

Some of the honourable Members of this House and their staff have had painful personal experiences of this in the immediate vicinity of the Parliament building in Brussels.
That is also the reason why, as soon as the Berlin wall fell, the Union responded to the challenge and reacted decisively and proactively to the change in the European political landscape.
Should we enlarge it to include Turkey, on the borders of Kirkuk which is currently being bombed?

Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
In a nutshell: the European Union is of the firm conviction that a policy of constructive dialogue has more chance of success than one of isolation and embargoes.
What are we asking?
On many previous occasions, we have pretended that we have achieved results.
Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks.
Finally - and probably the most important point - we need one competition policy for one market.
The Union's faith in the multilateral approach, which it had ten years ago, is even stronger today.
How casual and offhand can you be, Commissioner, to threaten the future of an entire industry on such a slender basis?
We want to make direct payments that are compatible with the market and with our international trading obligations.
Finally, I want to say that our group will request a separate vote on Amendments Nos 20 and 21 in order to clarify anything that may be obscure.
For this reason we can accept Amendment No 44 in principle, which requires the Commission to consider a range of economic instruments and report back to Parliament and the Council.

If Amendments 19 to the Prets report and 14 to the Ilvari report are carried, we will have real problems when it comes to the conciliation.
Commissioner Wallström said that men elect men.
Ex ante regulation should be used in cases such as universal services, when there is strong public interest, but once markets are fully competitive, then reasons for broad ex ante regulation will essentially diminish.
Lastly, the question of Eurostat.
Nonetheless, Mr Prodi, Members of the House also like to discuss what has taken place during these four years and what has not worked well.
Mr President, I believe we can say with satisfaction that the European Parliament has worked to ensure that Euro-Mediterranean relations are a priority with the European Union’s foreign policy.
If both our new eastern and southern neighbours can make progress in the field of economic development, security and human rights, this will ultimately be to our benefit.

The strategy itself touched on risks in this area.
It will produce uniform legislation instead of a diversity of solutions.
Clearly, a consequence of extending the reference periods would be to increase the flexibility available to companies.
What is needed is to make that agency function, not to consider endlessly to whom it should be accountable, so that it is the engine of cooperation among the Member States in the fight against terrorism.

This commitment is demonstrated by the regulation, adopted by the European Council in July 2003, on aid for policies and actions on reproductive health.
Mr President, the European Capital of Culture programme is one of the European Union's success stories.
Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met.

Whilst it may take these nations and countries longer than the Romanians, Bulgarians and Croats, I think the doors to the European Union should be open for them.
The crisis marked a departure from our European way of doing business.

Tell Turkey to get off the island so that northern Cyprus can develop.
You have my heartfelt support in this, and I wish you much success in this respect.
The main feat of the Kok report is that it clearly demonstrates the relevance, if not, necessity, of the Lisbon strategy.
Through what you have done and are doing through your Regional Policy, you have succeeded to combine what is practically necessary with what is morally correct.

However, any alternative solutions would have an extremely adverse impact on the operation of the Structural Funds and on cohesion policies from 2007 onwards.
With enlargement, the Union has clearly extended its borders with some new neighbours.

It is Europe’s competitiveness that determines whether people in the European Union have work and the wherewithal to live.
The fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over.
These issues have also been addressed in Mr Moscovici's report on Romania.
He is in Buenos Aires and asked me to replace him.
Can we pretend that this will not happen?
In reality, the criminal mullahs are the real terrorists.
In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe.
Exempting compensation paid to hospitals and social housing is a first step, but we think that others should be added to the list.
Thus, possible weaknesses will be addressed and a future environmental policy will be laid down which is more efficient, more focused and more cost-effective.
The report also overshoots the mark when it comes to dealing with tobacco smoke.
The Committee on Agriculture has already said that the protection of biodiversity is not a primary or genuine rural development policy.
That is not the case.
This directive provides consumer protection and, at the same time, it is good both for the internal market and for our competitiveness in general.
I believe that these 19 amendments, all of which my group will be voting to support, have enabled us to achieve a good compromise, one to which we can consent with a clear conscience and with confidence.
